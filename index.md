Welcome to my CS Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, highlighting my skills in **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**. Each project below demonstrates my ability program, to enhance existing software, apply computer science principles, and deliver professional, secure, and valuable computing solutions.

# Portfolio Projects

## Project 1: Software Engineering and Design
**Enhanced Inventory Management Mobile App**

This artifact is a mobile application originally developed for CS-360, where users can login, add and remove items from an inventory list, add categories and put items into them, and sort the items by name or quantity. I enhanced it by adding new features to improve its usability and architecture.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Added inventory iyem **categories**.
- Implemented **sorting** for items by name and quantity.
- Introduced a **multi-select** feature for batch operations.
- Refactored code for better **modularity and maintainability**.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- UI/UX Design
- Modular Software Architecture
- Mobile Development (Android)
- Problem Solving & Feature Integration

**Aligned Course Outcomes:**
- **Outcome 3:** Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and best practices.
- **Outcome 4:** Use innovative techniques and tools to implement solutions that deliver value.

## Project 2: Algorithms & Data Structures
**3D Scene with Collision Detection**

This artifact is an interactive 3D scene built with OpenGL and C++ from my CS-330 course, where you can move around in using keyboard and mouse controls. I enhanced it by implementing collision, a core algorithmic feature to increase realism.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Implemented **Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)** collision detection.
- Prevented the camera from passing through objects in the 3D environment.
- Evaluated trade-offs between performance and precision.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Algorithm Design & Implementation (Collision Detection)
- 3D Graphics Programming
- Performance vs. Precision Analysis
- Incremental Testing & Debugging

**Aligned Course Outcomes:**
- **Outcome 3:** Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles.
- **Outcome 4:** Apply well-founded techniques to implement computer solutions.

## Project 3: Databases
**Cloud-Integrated Inventory Management App**

For this enhancement, I took the same Inventory Management App from Project 1 and fundamentally upgraded its data layer to use modern, cloud-based technologies.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Migrated the local **SQLite** database to **Google Firebase Firestore**.
- Implemented **real-time data synchronization** across devices.
- Added **user authentication** (Email & Google Sign-In).
- Configured **security rules** to ensure data privacy and integrity.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Cloud Database Design & Migration
- Real-time Data Synchronization
- Authentication & Authorization
- Security-First Mindset

**Aligned Course Outcomes:**
- **Outcome 4:** Use innovative techniques and tools to implement valuable solutions.
- **Outcome 5:** Develop a security mindset to ensure privacy and data security.
