## Professional Self-Assessment

My journey through Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program has transformed how I approach software development. Over the past three years, I've evolved from writing basic programs to architecting full-stack applications with security and scalability in mind. This portfolio represents that growth, showcasing not just what I've built, but how I've learned to think like an engineer who balances technical excellence with real-world practicality.

**Building a Foundation Through Diverse Experiences**

What surprised me most about this program wasn't just learning programming languages, but developing a comprehensive problem-solving mindset. Beyond the technical artifacts you'll see here, some of my most valuable learning came from courses that challenged me to think holistically:

- **CS-310 (Collaboration)** taught me that the best software emerges from teamwork, code reviews, and respecting diverse approaches to problem-solving
- **CS-405 (Secure Coding)** fundamentally changed how I write code—security became something I consider from the first line, not an afterthought
- **CS-250 (Software Development Lifecycle)** gave me real-world experience with agile methodologies and the complete development process
- **CS-350 (Emerging Systems)** exposed me to distributed systems and the challenges of concurrent programming

These experiences showed me that technical skill is only part of the equation. The most effective developers are also strong communicators, thoughtful collaborators, and continuous learners.

**Core Competencies and Professional Values:**

**Collaborating in Team Environments**  
My work in CS-310 provided practical experience with the rhythms of professional software development. Through structured team projects, I participated in code reviews, maintained changelogs, and learned that successful collaboration requires both technical synchronization and clear communication. I discovered that the best solutions often emerge when diverse perspectives are welcomed and respected.

**Communicating with Stakeholders**  
Throughout multiple projects, I've practiced translating technical concepts for different audiences. Whether explaining technical trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders or creating documentation for development teams, I've learned to focus on what matters most to each audience. This skill proved crucial when designing user interfaces that balance technical constraints with user needs.

**Data Structures and Algorithms**  
My coursework provided deep exposure to algorithmic thinking—from implementing complex data structures in CS-260 to optimizing performance in computational graphics. I've developed a systematic approach to problem-solving that considers time and space complexity while understanding the practical trade-offs involved in design choices.

**Software Engineering and Database Design**  
The program instilled in me the importance of engineering principles like modular design, separation of concerns, and systematic testing. I've applied these across multiple platforms, from mobile development with Android to full-stack applications. My database experience spans from relational design with SQL to modern NoSQL solutions, always with attention to data integrity and performance.

**Security-First Mindset**  
Security considerations have become integral to my development process. Through secure coding courses and practical application, I've learned to anticipate vulnerabilities and implement protective measures from the outset. I now approach every project asking "how could this be misused?" rather than treating security as a final checklist item.

**A Cohesive Portfolio Demonstrating Full-Stack Capabilities:**

The three enhancements in this portfolio were chosen to demonstrate my range across different computer science domains while showing how these skills integrate in practice. Together, they tell the story of a developer who can:

- **Engineer user-centered applications** that solve practical problems through thoughtful design
- **Apply algorithmic thinking** to create efficient, realistic solutions in demanding environments
- **Architect modern data systems** that scale, synchronize across devices, and maintain security

What makes this portfolio unique is how each enhancement demonstrates iterative improvement and practical problem-solving. I didn't just complete assignments, I identified real limitations in existing software and implemented meaningful solutions using industry-relevant technologies.

The **Inventory Management App** enhancements show my focus on creating software that genuinely helps people work better. By adding categories, sorting, and batch operations, I transformed a basic CRUD app into a tool that adapts to real workflow needs.

The **3D Scene collision detection** demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic thinking to create more immersive experiences. The process of implementing AABB collision detection taught me the value of choosing solutions that balance performance with practicality.

The **Cloud database migration** represents my growth in thinking about software at scale. Moving from local storage to cloud synchronization required rethinking data architecture while maintaining security and performance—exactly the kind of challenge I'll face in professional environments.

**Looking Forward**

As I complete my degree, I'm excited to bring this combination of technical skill and practical thinking to a professional development team. I'm looking for an environment where I can contribute to meaningful projects, continue learning from experienced developers, and help build software that makes a difference.

My goal is to work as a full-stack developer with a focus on creating secure, efficient applications, and the work in this portfolio shows that I have the foundation to do exactly that. I'm not just ready to write code; I'm ready to understand requirements, collaborate with teams, and deliver solutions that provide real value.

Thank you for exploring my portfolio. The artifacts that follow demonstrate these competencies in action, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.

## Portfolio Projects

### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design
**Enhanced Inventory Management Mobile App**

This artifact is a mobile application originally developed for CS-360, where users can login, add and remove items from an inventory list, add categories and put items into them, and sort the items by name or quantity. I enhanced it by adding new features to improve its usability and architecture.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Added inventory **categories**.
- Implemented multi-criteria **sorting** for items (name A-Z/Z-A, quantity high-low/low-high).
- Introduced a **multi-select** feature for batch operations.
- Refactored code for better **modularity and maintainability**.
