Welcome to my CS Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, highlighting my skills in **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**. Each project below demonstrates my ability program, to enhance existing software, apply computer science principles, and deliver professional, secure, and valuable computing solutions.

## Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

This artifact is a mobile application originally developed for CS-360, where users can login, add and remove items from an inventory list, add categories and put items into them, and sort the items by name or quantity. I enhanced it by adding new features to improve its usability and architecture.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Added inventory iyem **categories**.
- Implemented **sorting** for items by name and quantity.
- Introduced a **multi-select** feature for batch operations.
- Refactored code for better **modularity and maintainability**.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- UI/UX Design
- Modular Software Architecture
- Mobile Development (Android)
- Problem Solving & Feature Integration

**Aligned Course Outcomes:**
- **Outcome 3:** Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and best practices.
- **Outcome 4:** Use innovative techniques and tools to implement solutions that deliver value.
